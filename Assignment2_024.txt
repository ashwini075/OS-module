Report error if a directory/file exists with the same name.
--->
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10}
do
        mkdir a$i
done
exit 0
...........
output:
uni-ash@DESKTOP-TCF8H4O:~$ ./a2_1.sh
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘a1’: File exists
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘a2’: File exists
uni-ash@DESKTOP-TCF8H4O:~$ ls
-     a2       a7       as.txt      dsss      fork1.sh   movies     s3
1.sh  a2_1.sh  a8       c           file1     fork.sh    p1         s4
2.sh  a3       a9       cal.sh      file1.sh  head.txt   root_dir   s5

2. Write a menu based script to perform following string operations
a) To find length of a string
c) Copying string
d) Concatenation of strings
e) Compare two strings
f) Reversing a string
-->
#!/bin/bash
echo "give string"
read string
#finding length of string
len=echo "length=${#string}"

#copying string
abc = $string
echo "newstring=$string"

#concat strings
str1="sai"
str2="baba"
echo conatstring= $str1$str2

#reversing a string
echo "$string" | rev

#comparing string
read -p "enter str1:" str1
read -p "enter str2:" str2

if [[ "$str1" == "$str2" ]]; then
        echo "both are equal"
else
        echo "both are unequal"
fi

....
output:
uni-ash@DESKTOP-TCF8H4O:~$ ./a2_2.sh
give string
ashwini
./a2_2.sh: line 5: length=7: command not found
./a2_2.sh: line 8: abc: command not found
newstring=ashwini
conatstring= saibaba
iniwhsa
enter str1:compare
enter str2:comparee
both are unequal
